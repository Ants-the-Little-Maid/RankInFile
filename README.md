# Rank in File

Action buttons for **WoW Forever** that hold one rank of a spell, with a pop-out menu for
swapping ranks, including during combat.

## Spell picker and minimap button

Click the **minimap button** (book icon), or type `/rf spells`, to open the spell picker.
It looks like the spellbook: one tab per spell school, two columns of spells, with pages.

- **Click or drag a spell**: Rank in File makes its macro and puts it on your cursor. Click an
  action bar slot to place it. Spells you've added get a green tick and their button number.
- **Right-click** an added spell to remove it, along with its macro.
- **Drop a spell** from Blizzard's spellbook or your bars onto the picker to do the same.
- **"Only spells with more than one rank"** hides spells that have a single rank.
- The bottom bar has the **Floating buttons**, **Lock** and **Menu opens** settings.

Minimap button: left-click opens the picker, right-click opens settings, and dragging moves it
around the minimap. `/rf minimap off` hides it.

## Moving from Rank Flyout

Rank in File was called Rank Flyout before 0.4.0. Delete the old `RankFlyout` folder from
`Interface\AddOns` (or disable it), then log in. On each character, Rank in File moves your Rank Flyout
bar macros across, along with the key bindings on those buttons, so your bars keep working. Positions, menu direction and
scale start fresh, and floating buttons start hidden (`/rf float on` shows them).

## Updating from 0.4.0

0.4.0 saved one set of buttons for your whole account. From 0.4.1 each character has its own.
The first character you log in with takes the 0.4.0 buttons for spells it knows, plus any its
bar macros or key bindings use, and the old account-wide set is then removed. Characters that
already have their buttons keep them unchanged. Any other character starts empty.

## Using it

1. Type `/rf add Frostbolt` (or `/rf add` and drop a spell from your spellbook onto the new button).
2. **Drag the button onto any action bar slot.** That drops a macro there, so the slot's
   normal hotkey casts it. No extra key bindings needed.
3. On the bar slot (or the floating button):
   - **Click or hotkey** casts the chosen rank.
   - **Right-click** opens the rank menu beside the slot.
     - Left-click a rank: use that rank from now on.
     - Right-click a rank: cast that rank once, without changing the choice.
4. `/rf float off` hides the floating buttons once your macros are on bars.
5. **Shift-drag** moves a floating button. `/rf lock` stops moving.

The bar slot shows the chosen rank's icon, tooltip, cooldown and range, and its label reads
"Rank 3". If you swap ranks during combat, the cast changes straight away, but the slot's
icon, label and tooltip catch up when combat ends (WoW blocks editing macros in combat).

Each button uses one character macro. If your 30 character macro slots are full, delete one
first. `/rf remove` deletes it. Rank in File doesn't make or change account macros: they are
shared by all your characters, and each character's buttons are different. An account macro
from an older version still casts the chosen rank, but its icon and label don't follow rank
changes; `/rf macro <n>` makes a character macro to replace it.

Buttons are saved per character: each character has its own 12, with their own spells, ranks
and positions. Menu direction, scale, lock, floating buttons and the minimap button are shared
by all your characters.

If you choose the highest rank, the button moves up to new ranks as you learn them.
If you choose a lower rank, it stays on that rank.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/rf spells` | Open or close the spell picker |
| `/rf minimap on\|off` | Show or hide the minimap button |
| `/rf add [spell]` | New button (up to 12) |
| `/rf macro <n>` | Put button n's macro on your cursor, to click into a bar slot |
| `/rf float on\|off` | Show or hide the floating buttons |
| `/rf set <n> <spell>` | Change what button n holds |
| `/rf remove <n>` | Remove button n |
| `/rf list` | List buttons and their chosen ranks |
| `/rf lock` / `/rf unlock` | Stop or allow Shift-drag moving |
| `/rf dir up\|down\|left\|right` | Which way the menu opens |
| `/rf scale <0.5-2>` | Button size |
| `/rf reset` | Move buttons back to the middle of the screen |

Adding, removing and moving buttons only work out of combat. Choosing ranks works anywhere.

## How it works

- The bar macro is:
  ```
  #showtooltip Frostbolt(Rank 3)
  /click [btn:2] RankInFileButton1 RightButton; RankInFileButton1
  ```
  Forever's `/click` calls `button:Click(mouseButton, down)` once, with `down = false`
  unless the macro says otherwise. The buttons set `useOnKeyDown = false` so that single
  click casts whatever the "cast on key down" option is.
- The menu is parented to `UIParent` and, out of combat, anchored beside the bar slot that
  holds the button's macro (Blizzard bars, Bartender4 and Dominos), or else the floating
  button. A macro slot reports either the macro index or (subType `"spell"`) the spell it
  shows, so a slot only matches on our macro index, or on one of our rank IDs plus our
  macro's name. When the macro is on more than one slot, a `PreClick` hook moves the menu
  beside the slot under the mouse before the secure `OnClick` shows it. That only works out
  of combat; in combat the menu opens where it was last placed. It stays beside that slot
  through bar updates while the slot still holds the macro.
- "Hidden" floating buttons stay shown at alpha 0 with the mouse off, so `/click` and key
  bindings still reach them.
- Each button is a `SecureActionButtonTemplate` button with `type = "spell"` and the rank's
  spell ID in `spell`. Blizzard's `SECURE_ACTIONS.spell` casts a numeric value with `CastSpellByID`.
- Rank choice is changed by secure snippets wrapped onto `OnClick` (`SecureHandlerWrapScript`),
  so it works under combat lockdown. The menu is a protected frame the snippets show and hide.
- Ranks come from a scan of the player spellbook: every learned, non-passive entry with the same
  name. Lower ranks are real spellbook items; Blizzard's spellbook only hides them unless the
  `ShowAllSpellRanks` option is on (`C_SpellBook.IsSpellBookItemLowRank`).
- The spellbook is rescanned on `SPELLS_CHANGED` and `LEARNED_SPELL_IN_SKILL_LINE`. If that
  happens in combat, the rescan waits until combat ends.
- Cooldowns: `isActive` (never secret) decides whether to show one. Plain times go to
  `SetCooldown`, as in 0.2.0. In instances the start and duration times are secret, and
  `SetCooldown` rejects secret values from addon code (it is `AllowedWhenUntainted`), so
  those go through `C_Spell.GetSpellCooldownDuration` and `SetCooldownFromDurationObject`.
  An unexpected error clears the swipe and is reported once per session, not on every event.
- The usable/range tint checks `issecretvalue` and leaves the icon white for secret answers.

## Checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Lua 5.1 parse (luaparse 0.3.1), including the three secure snippets | Pass |
| Smoke test `tests/rankinfile_smoke.lua` (fengari, stubbed API, including secret values and the move from Rank Flyout) | 161 of 161 passed (0.4.3) |
| In the Forever client | 0.4.3 not yet run in the client |

Points to check in the client:

1. Secure snippets run on this build (early Forever betas had a bug here, reported fixed in 70009).
2. Casting a lower rank's spell ID casts that rank, not the highest one.
3. Rank swapping in combat.
4. The button textures (`ButtonHilight-Square`, `UI-Quickslot-Depress`, `CheckButtonHilight`,
   `Arrow-Up-Up`) exist in the Forever client.
5. Key bindings, and Shift-drag moving.
6. The bar macro: hotkey casts, right-click opens the menu beside the slot, and
   `#showtooltip Frostbolt(Rank 3)` shows that rank's icon and tooltip.
7. Dragging the floating button picks up the macro (and doesn't also cast).
8. 0.3.0 spell picker: the window, tabs, class portrait, paging, dropping spells on it,
   and that a picked spell's macro lands on the cursor ready for a bar slot.
9. 0.3.0 minimap button: the book icon, the right-click settings menu, and dragging.
10. 0.3.1: fight in a dungeon with `/console scriptErrors 1` (or BugSack). There should be no
    errors, and the cooldown swipe should still show on the bar slot and floating button.
11. 0.4.0: with the old `RankFlyout` folder removed, logging in moves its bar macros (same
    slots, same rank) and key bindings, and prints what moved. Check a second character too. With it still enabled, a chat
    line asks you to disable it and nothing moves.
12. 0.4.1 to 0.4.3: buttons are per character. Coming from 0.4.0, the first character to log
    in keeps the buttons for spells it knows plus the ones its bars use. A rank chosen on one
    character doesn't change another's.
13. 0.4.1: with the same macro on two bar slots, right-clicking each opens the menu beside
    that slot (out of combat), and casting from either slot still works in combat.
14. 0.4.3: after `/rf remove`, a key that was bound to that button casts nothing. Starting
    combat during a Shift-drag gives no blocked-action error.
